## Day 4 - DOM
> Do exercise 1 in the pizza.js file

#### Exercise 1

The HTML file for this exercise is **pizza.html**, and the JS file is **pizza.js**.

The site has a form to order a pizza. The form has a checkbox in which the user can choose toppings.
The price of each additive is stored in the ```data-price``` attribute.
Write appropriate events so that after selecting checkbox options the correct order amount was shown, and after sending the form the following information was displayed inside the ```page-info``` element: **"Payable: [the amount]"**, where [the amount] is the order amount. Remember that clicking on the button triggers the default action of reloading the page. Block this action so that you can see the information entered into ```page-info```.

Note the two special checkboxes:
* Clear &ndash; that should deselect all other options,
* All toppings &ndash; that should select all other options (except none and clear).
