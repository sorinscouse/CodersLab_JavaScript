# Searching for elements on an HTML page

> Write your answers in the **app.js** file, unless the instructions tell you otherwise.
Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.

**Do not modify the HTML code unless the instructions say otherwise.**

## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Collecting items  (~ 5min - 10min)

 1. Find the first `h1` element on the page,
 2. Find the element with the `title` **class**,
 3. Find the element with `data-animation` attribute.

Write every found element in the console to make sure your code works.

### Writing the number of elements  (~ 5min - 10min)

Write in the console:

 1. How many `div`s are on the page,
 2. How many elements with `oferts` class are on the page,
 3. How many elements with `href` attribute are on the page.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 10min - 15min)
Find the following elements of the page and save them in variables with appropriate names:
1. Element with ```home``` **id** (two ways).
2. First **li** element with ```data-direction``` attribute.
3. First element with ```block``` **class**.

Remember to check every time if you have loaded the right item. Use functions that search for one element only.

### Exercise 2 (~ 5min - 10min)
Find the following elements of the page and save them in variables with appropriate names:
1. All **li** elements in the ```nav``` **tag**.
2. All **paragraphs** placed in any **div** element.
3. All **divs** in the ```article``` **tag**.

Remember to check every time if you have loaded the right items. Use functions that search for many elements at once. Each time write in the console how many elements you have found.

### Exercise 3 (~ 5min - 10min)
1. Find ```article``` **tag** with ```first``` **class** on the page and save it in a variable with an  appropriate name.
2. Next:
  * write in the console, how many **h1** elements are in this **tag**.

Remember to check every time if you have loaded the right items.
