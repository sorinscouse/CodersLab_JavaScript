# Advanced functions &ndash; exercises

> Write your answers in the **app.js** file, unless the instructions tell you otherwise.
Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.

## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Scopes (~ 5min - 10min)

Take a look at **app.js** and test both functions.
Why doesn't the function named **one** have access to **variable2**?
To confirm that you understand this topic, write a comment for each line of code.

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 5min - 10min)

Take a look at **exercise01.js** and test the ```sortArray``` function.
To confirm that you understand this topic, write a comment for each line of code.

### Exercise 2 (~ 10min - 15min)

Take a look at **exercise02.js** and test the ```callOtherFunction``` function.
Try to call it a couple of times more giving it other tasks :)


### Exercise 3 (~ 5min - 10min)

In **exercise03.js**, create a function that will write "Hello" in the console. Test where the function is called.
First, call it after defining the function, then - before. Write your observations in a comment.
Next, create another function that will write other text (e.g. "Good morning") in the console. Write it as a functional expression (in other words, assign it to a variable). Then, try to test where it is being called, just like you did with the first function. Write your observations in a comment.
