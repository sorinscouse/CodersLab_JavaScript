# Creating and deleting elements

> Write the answers in appropriate files unless the instructions tell you otherwise.
Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.

## Exercises done with the lecturer

### Order (~ 7min - 12min)

Open the page exerciseLecturer.html.
The page contains a table with orders. Next to each order there is a button that is used to delete this order.
Add an appropriate event to it, that will cause the order to disappear from the table. Try to do it in such a way that all buttons use the same event (use ```this```).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1  (~ 10min - 15min)

On the page prepared for this exercise, there is a list and a button. Add appropriate events to them so that clicking the button resulted in adding a new element to the list. An element should have the information about the number of elements that already are on the list at the time when this one is added.

### Exercise 2  (~ 10min - 15min)

There is a table containing information about the orders (with two orders already filled) on the page.
Below, there is a form that adds a new order. Write an event that will extract information from the inputs (```el.value```) and add a new entry to the table.

### Exercise 3  (~ 10min - 15min)

There is a button on the page. You must add an event to it in such a way that when clicked, the button is deleted from the page.

### Exercise 4  (~ 10min - 15min)

On the page, there is a list with multiple entries, and a button. Write an event that deletes all children of the list when the button is clicked. The ```ul.list``` element should remain on the page.

### Exercise 5 (~ 15min - 20min)

There are two lists on the page. Next to each entry (in both lists) there are buttons.
Write JavaScript code that will move an element of one list to the other list when a corresponding button is clicked.
Remember that an element can be moved multiple times (e.g. list 1 to list 2, and then back to list 1).
