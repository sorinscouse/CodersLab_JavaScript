# More about the element, influencing a DOM element

> **index.html** is divided into parts intended for each exercise.
Remember to search for elements only in the **div** for the exercise that you are currently doing.
Exercises should be completed in **app.js**.
Remember to separate exercises with comments, and write legible, well-formatted code.

**Do not modify the HTML code unless the instructions say otherwise.**

## Exercise done with the lecturer

### Searching, data attribute  (~ 7min - 12min)

(Take a look at the element with ```ex5``` class)

Modify the list as follows:
1. Set the background color of every second list item to green.
2. Give the fifth element of the list ```big``` **class**.
3. Set underlining for every third element.

## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1  (~ 15min - 20min)
(Take a look at the element with ```ex1``` class)

On the website there are three images with icons of the most popular internet browsers. Unfortunately, both images and links to their pages contain errors.
Write JavaScript code that will make the following changes:
1. It will correct the elements so that the right logo is linked to every browser (the image is set using ```background-image```).
2. It will correct the links so that each has the correct description and ```href``` attribute.
3. It will adjust the width of the element with the ```chrome``` class (should be: 100px).

In the console, look what the CSS code added by JavaScript looks like. Think about why it is added here.
Write the answer to this question in a comment to the exercise.

### Exercise 2 (~ 5min - 10min)
(Take a look at the element with ```ex2``` class)

There is a list on the webpage where you have to enter your first and last name, your favorite color and dish.
1. Fin the right elements (span) and save them to variables.
2. Fill in the appropriate information using ```innerText```.

### Exercise 3 (~ 10min - 15min)
(Take a look at the element with ```ex3``` class)

The website has a simple menu. Both HTML and CSS are already prepared for it. Unfortunately, someone forgot to add appropriate classes to the elements.
1. Find the ```ul``` element and give it ```menu``` class.
2. Find all ```li``` elements and add ```menuElement``` class to them (use a loop). Be careful not to delete the ```selected``` class.
3. Note that one of the elements has a red text color. This is caused by its ```error``` **class**. Delete it (preferably delete this **class** in all elements that have it).

### Exercise 4 (~ 10min - 15min)
(Take a look at the element with ```ex4``` class)

Give every element of the list a ```data-id``` attribute that takes consecutive integers (starting from 1).
