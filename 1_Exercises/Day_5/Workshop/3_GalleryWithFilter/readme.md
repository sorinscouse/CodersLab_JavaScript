## Gallery with filter

Write a gallery in which you will store images with appropriate tags.
Typing the tag and clicking the button should make the images with this tag disappear or appear.

The instructions are divided into sections. Remember to follow them strictly and do the work section after section.
Do not forget to commit the finished code!

## Section 1
Read the HTML and CSS code prepared for this task. Usually, we use a div with an appropriate id for such a gallery.

## Section 2
Prepare the **app.js** file so you can work in it.
Then, find the following elements and save them in variables:

1. All images from the gallery (save them in an array).
2. Button that will cause the images to disappear.
3. Button that will cause the images to appear.
4. Input that we will add tags to.

Display the variables in the console to verify if they contain the right data.

## Section 3
Add events on mouse click to the buttons. Check if they work by writing something in the console.

## Section 4
Modify the events so that they display the text from the input and then clear it.
Save that text in a variable.

## Section 5
Modify the events so that they also write every tag of every image (to do this, you must use a loop and dataset).

## Section 6
Modify the events so that they display only the tags with the input text (use ```indexOf```).

## Section 7
Modify the events so that instead of displaying the tag for the image (only for those that have the right tag), they add an ```invisible``` class to the images or delete it - depending on the button.

## Section 8
Check how your page works. Can you see any problems? If so, describe them.
