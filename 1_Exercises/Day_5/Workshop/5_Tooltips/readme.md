## Tooltips

Write tooltips. They are small pop-ups with additional information that appear when you hover over an element. This will be a simple version of what you can find here: https://jqueryui.com/tooltip/. The text that will display in a tooltip should be kept in dataset.

The instructions are divided into sections. Remember to follow them strictly and do the work section after section.
Do not forget to commit the finished code!

## Section 1
Read the HTML and CSS code prepared for this task.

## Section 2
Prepare the **app.js** file so you can work in it.

Then, find elements with ```tooltip``` **class** (there might be many of them) and save them in variables.
Display the variables in the console to verify if they contain the right data.

## Section 3
Add two events: ```mouseover``` and ```mouseout``` to each element with ```tooltip``` **class** . Make them write something in the console to check if the events work correctly.

## Section 4
Modify the events so that they display tooltip text in the console, which we will be adding later.

## Section 5
Modify the ```mouseover``` event. It should add a new element to the one that it is called on. An example of an element to be added is written in a comment at the beginning of **app.js**.

## Section 6
Modify the ```mouseout``` so that it deletes the tooltip created in the previous section.

## Section 7
Check how your page works. Can you see any problems? If so, describe them.
