## To-do list

Write a to-do list. The page should have the following properties:

1. After entering a task and clicking the ```Add task``` button, the new task (with the appropriate content) should be added to the list. At the same time, two new buttons should appear: one for marking the task as done, and one for deleting the task (sample exercise is in a comment in HTML).
2. Clicking the ```Complete``` button should change the font of the task to red (if the task is completed). Clicking the button again will change the color back to the default one (color of an incomplete task).
3. After the ```Delete``` button is clicked, the task should disappear from the list.
4. After the ```Remove finished tasks``` button is clicked, all completed tasks should disappear from the list.
5. A task can be added only if its content is more than five and less than one hundred characters long.
6. After a task is added, the input value should reset.
7. There is a counter above the list that shows how many tasks we have yet to complete.

### For volunteers ( * ):
Add a second **input** to the page in which you will set priorities for tasks (as integers ranging from **1** to **10**).
A task must always be added to the list in the right place (Priority **10** at the top, priority **0** at the bottom).


## Remember:
Plan your work in advance and break it down into stages (similarly to previous tasks).
Do not do everything at once!
