## Exercises to do on your own

### Exercise 1 (~ 10min - 15min)

Write a function named ```countHello()``` that will take an integer between 1-10 as its parameter. Initiate setInterval function within that function. The setInterval should write "Hello" in the console and count how many times it was started.
If the counter reaches the number given to the function as parameter, the setInterval should be deleted.
